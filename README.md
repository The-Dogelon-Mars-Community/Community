**The Dogelon Mars Community
**

Hello and welcome to The Dogelon Mars Community on Github.
This is our place, our space station, if you will, to start an open and honest Dogelon Mars project of your own. You can either decide to build on top of the current implementations of Dogelon Mars, or start your own. We are here to support anyone who has a desire to join the Mission to Mars. 

**Who Can Help?**
As more projects come to life, we'll be looking for all types people to help out with any number of avenues. This is all very new and still being organized, but if you have an idea or a suggestion, don't be shy to reach out!

**Build:**
If you have a project you need a home for, or want to help with existing open-source projects, we'd love to have you! Check out our projects to see what's being worked on and learn how to help or submit a new project.

**Design and UX:**
We all love pretty things, and we love the people who make things pretty even more! Help us look our best! And if it isn't intuitive and easy to use, nobody will use it. Come Help!

**Issues**
Create a new issue for anything that you would like to discusss. Items of community direction, ideas, and complaints can all be added here.

**Policing:**
There's no shortage of shady people in the blockchain world. Help us by reporting anything you see that doesn't look right. Help us find the scammers and the spammers and report them to the community page so we can mobiilize the Shib Army to have bad actors taken down.
